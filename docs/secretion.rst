****************************************

Secretion "by cell type" can and should be handled by the appropriate
PDE solver. To implement secretion from individual cells using Python, we
first add the secretion plugin in CC3DML:

.. code-block:: xml

    <Plugin Name="Secretion"/>

or as:

.. code-block:: xml

    <Plugin Name="SecretionLocalFlex"/>


The inclusion of the above code in the CC3DML will allow users to
implement secretion for individual cells from Python.

.. note::

    Secretion for individual cells invoked via Python will be called only once per
    MCS.

.. warning::

    Although the secretion plugin can be used to implement secretion by
    cell type, **we strongly advise against doing so**. Defining
    secretion by cell type in the ``Secretion`` plugin will lead to performance
    degradation on multi-core machines. Please see the section below for more
    information if you are still interested in using secretion by cell type
    inside the ``Secretion`` plugin.

Typical use of secretion from Python is demonstrated best in the example
below:

.. code-block:: python

    class SecretionSteppable(SecretionBasePy):
        def __init__(self, _simulator, _frequency=1):
            SecretionBasePy.__init__(self, _simulator, _frequency)

        def step(self, mcs):
            attrSecretor = self.getFieldSecretor("ATTR")
            for cell in self.cellList:
                if cell.type == 3:
                    attrSecretor.secreteInsideCell(cell, 300)
                    attrSecretor.secreteInsideCellAtBoundary(cell, 300)
                    attrSecretor.secreteOutsideCellAtBoundary(cell, 500)
                    attrSecretor.secreteInsideCellAtCOM(cell, 300)
                elif cell.type == 2:
                    attrSecretor.secreteInsideCellConstantConcentration(cell, 300)

.. note::

    Instead of using ``SteppableBasePy`` class we are using
    ``SecretionBasePy`` class. This ensures that 
    the secretion plugin will be performed before diffusion by
    calling the Python secretion steppable *before* each Monte Carlo
    Step. 

There is no magic to ``SecretionBasePy`` - if you still want to use
``SteppableBasePy`` as a base class for secretion do so, but remember that you need to set flag:

.. code-block:: python

    self.runBeforeMCS=1

to ensure that your new steppable will run before each MCS. See example
below for alternative implementation of ``SecretionSteppable`` using
``SteppableBasePy`` as a base class:

.. code-block:: python

    class SecretionSteppable(SteppableBasePy):
        def __init__(self,_simulator,_frequency=1):
            SteppableBasePy.__init__(self,_simulator, _frequency)
            self.runBeforeMCS=1
        def step(self,mcs):
            attrSecretor=self.getFieldSecretor("ATTR")
            for cell in self.cellList:
                if cell.type==3:
                    attrSecretor.secreteInsideCell(cell,300)
                    attrSecretor.secreteInsideCellAtBoundary(cell,300)
                    attrSecretor.secreteOutsideCellAtBoundary(cell,500)
                    attrSecretor.secreteOutsideCellAtBoundaryOnContactwith(cell,500,[2,3])
                    attrSecretor.secreteInsideCellAtCOM(cell,300)
                    attrSecretor.uptakeInsideCellAtCOM(cell,300,0.2)
                elif cell.type==2:
                    attrSecretor.secreteInsideCellConstantConcentration(cell,300)

The secretion of individual cells is handled through ``FieldSecretor``
objects. ``FieldSecretor`` concept is quite convenient because the amount
of Python coding is quite small. To secrete a chemical from a cell, 
we first create a field secretor object:

.. code-block:: python

    attrSecretor = self.getFieldSecretor("ATTR")

which allows us to manipulate how much which cells secrete into the ``ATTR` field.

Then, we pick a cell, and using this field secretor, we simulate secretion of
chemical ``ATTR`` by a cell:

.. code-block:: python

    attrSecretor.secreteInsideCell(cell,300)

Currently, we support 7 secretion modes for individual cells:

1. ``secreteInsideCell`` – this is equivalent to secretion in every pixel
   belonging to a cell

2. ``secreteInsideCellConstantConcentration`` – this is equivalent to
   secretion in every pixel belonging to a cell and setting
   concentration to fixed, constant level

3. ``secreteInsideCellAtBoundary`` – secretion takes place in the pixels
   belonging to the cell boundary

4. ``secreteInsideCellAtBoundaryOnContactWith`` - secretion takes place in
   the pixels belonging to the cell boundary that touches any of the
   cells listed as the last argument of the function call

5. ``secreteOutsideCellAtBoundary`` – secretion takes place in pixels which
   are outside the cell but in contact with cell boundary pixels

6. ``secreteOutsideCellAtBoundaryOnContactWith`` - secretion takes place in
   pixels which are outside the cell but in contact with cell boundary
   pixels and in contact with cells listed the last argument of the
   function call

7. ``secreteInsideCellAtCOM`` – secretion at the center of mass of the cell

and 6 uptake modes:

1. ``uptakeInsideCell`` – this is equivalent to uptake in every pixel
   belonging to a cell

2. ``uptakeInsideCellAtBoundary`` – uptake takes place in the pixels
   belonging to the cell boundary

3. ``uptakeInsideCellAtBoundaryOnContactWith`` - uptake takes place in the
   pixels belonging to the cell boundary that touches any of the cells
   listed as the last argument of the function call

4. ``uptakeOutsideCellAtBoundary`` – uptake takes place in pixels which are
   outside the cell but in contact with cell boundary pixels

5. ``uptakeOutsideCellAtBoundaryOnContactWith`` - uptake takes place in
   pixels which are outside the cell but in contact with cell boundary
   pixels and in contact with cells listed the last argument of the
   function call

6. ``uptakeInsideCellAtCOM`` – uptake at the center of mass of the cell

Secretion functions use the following syntax:

.. code-block:: python

    secrete*(cell,amount,list_of_cell_types)

.. note::

    The ``list_of_cell_types`` is used only for function which
    implement such functionality *i.e.* ``secreteInsideCellAtBoundaryOnContactWith`` and
    ``secreteOutsideCellAtBoundaryOnContactWith``

Uptake functions use the following syntax:

.. code-block:: python

    uptake*(cell,max_amount,relative_uptake,list_of_cell_types)

.. note::

    The ``list_of_cell_types`` is used only for function which
    implement such functionality *i.e.* ``uptakeInsideCellAtBoundaryOnContactWith`` and
    ``uptakeOutsideCellAtBoundaryOnContactWith``

.. note::

    **Important:** The uptake works as follows: when available concentration
    is greater than ``max_amount``, then ``max_amount`` is subtracted from
    ``current_concentration``, otherwise we subtract
    ``relative_uptake*current_concentration``.

As you may infer from above, the modes 1-5 require tracking of pixels
belonging to cell and pixels belonging to cell boundary. If you are not
using those secretion modes you may disable pixel tracking by including:

.. code-block:: xml

    <DisablePixelTracker/>

or

.. code-block:: xml

    <DisableBoundaryPixelTracker/>

as shown in the example below:

.. code-block:: xml

    <Plugin Name="Secretion">

        <DisablePixelTracker/>
        <DisableBoundaryPixelTracker/>

        <Field Name="ATTR" ExtraTimesPerMC=”2”>
            <Secretion Type="Bacterium">200</Secretion>
            <SecretionOnContact Type="Medium" SecreteOnContactWith="B">300</SecretionOnContact>
            <ConstantConcentration Type="Bacterium">500</ConstantConcentration>
        </Field>
    </Plugin>

.. note::

    Make sure that fields into which you will be secreting
    chemicals exist. They are usually fields defined in PDE solvers. When
    using secretion plugin you do not need to specify ``SecretionData`` section
    for the PDE solvers.

When implementing e.g. secretion inside cell when the cell is in contact
with other cell we use neighbor tracker and a short script in the spirit
of the below snippet:

.. code-block:: python

    for cell in self.cellList:
        attrSecretor = self.getFieldSecretor("ATTR")
        for neighbor, commonSurfaceArea in self.getCellNeighborDataList(cell):
            if neighbor.type in [self.WALL]:
                attrSecretor.secreteInsideCell(cell, 300)
