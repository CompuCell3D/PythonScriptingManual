CC3D Python API
===============

.. note::

    The features described in this section are available as of CompuCell3D version 4.4.0.

CC3D provides a Python API to do all model and simulation specification in pure Python, whether in
the project structure generated by the `Twedit GUI <https://github.com/CompuCell3D/cc3d-twedit5>`_
for interactive execution using the `Player GUI <https://github.com/CompuCell3D/cc3d-player5>`_, or
in an arbitrary Python project (*e.g.*, integrated applications, cluster execution).
This section describes basic Python specification of CC3D simulations and built-in plugins and steppables,
and usage in CC3D project structures, arbitrary Python projects and a Jupyter Notebook.
