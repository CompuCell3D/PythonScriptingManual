Example: Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a cell transitions from an epithelial cell to a mesenchymal cell, it is a hallmark of cancer.
The cell loses its orderly, cube-like shape from its epithelial phenotype to a mesenchymal cell that has increased migrational capacity.
The mesenchymal cell may be elongated and fragment away from its neighbors to prepare for intravasation.

Key Takeaways:
    * Increasing contact energy between cells of the same type will move the cells apart
    * Decreasing contact energy between the mesenchymal cell and the medium will also help those cells move apart
    * Very high or low contact energy may cause cells to tear apart
