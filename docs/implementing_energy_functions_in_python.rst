Implementing Energy Functions in Python
=======================================

.. warning::

   Previous versions of CC3D allowed implementing energy functions in Python. Starting with 4.0.0 we are deprecating this feature. We strongly recommend that you write CC3D extensions such as energy functions or lattice monitors in C++ to achieve optimal performance. If you would like to write your own energy function we strongly recommend that you do this in C++. Twedit++ has C++ module assistant that generates template for any type of CompuCell3D C++ module and makes overall C++ CompuCell3D module development much easier. Go to CC3D C++ -> Generate New Module â€¦
