Python Scripting Manual for CompuCell3D - version 3.7.6
=======================================================

The focus of this manual is to teach you how to use Python scripting language to develop complex CompuCell3D simulations. We will assume that you have a working knowledge of Python. You do not have to be a Python guru but you should know how to write simple Python scripts that use functions, classes, dictionaries and lists. You can find decent tutorials online (e.g. `Instant Python Hacking <http://hetland.org/writing/instant-hacking.html>`__, or `Instant Python Hacking <http://hetland.org/writing>`__) or simply purchase a book on introductory Python programming.
